# mmhmm-streamdeck-plugin
A simple C# based plugin for StreamDeck and mmhmm
## Getting Started
The easiest way to get started is to download the file named "com.phxdev.mmhmm.streamDeckPlugin" in the "Plugin" folder. Just click the folder name, then the file name.
You should see a "Download" button. Save it to your computer. Double click it and Stream Deck should take care of the rest.

### PLEASE NOTE!
I have cross compiled this to work with Mac. Unfortunately, I don't have a Mac to test with. Mac users, if this plugin doesn't work, please raise an issue.
